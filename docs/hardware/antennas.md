## Antenna Types

| Type | Gain | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| J-Pole | 0 dBd | Omnidirectional, local |
| Yagi | 6-12 dBd | Directional, long links |
| Collinear | 3-6 dBd | Omnidirectional, range |

## Recommendations

- **Point-to-point links**: Yagi antennas aimed at neighbor
- **Local coverage**: Vertical omnidirectional
- **Separate antennas** for each radio port

## Feedline

- Use quality coax (LMR-400 or equivalent)
- Keep runs as short as practical
- Use proper weatherproofing outdoors
