# Network Rules

!!! note "Documentation In Progress"
    This page is under construction. Check back soon!

## Core Principles

1. **Dedicated links only** - No shared frequencies
2. **Coordinate first** - Work with neighbors before going live
3. **Maintain your links** - Keep equipment running reliably
4. **Be a good neighbor** - Don't cause interference

## Technical Requirements

- Use IL2P protocol when possible (better performance)
- 9600 baud preferred, 1200 baud minimum
- Properly identify your station

## Frequency Coordination

- Check with regional coordinator before selecting frequencies
- Avoid repeater inputs/outputs
- See [Frequency Allocation](frequencies.md)
